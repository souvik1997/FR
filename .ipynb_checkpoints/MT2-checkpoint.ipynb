    "3D printing objects comes with the disadvantage of having to print extra 'support structures' so that the printed object holds its shape. These lead to difigurations during post-processing and thus should be minimized. We can minimize them printing the objects in parts and gluing them later. In this exercize, we try to find the plane parallel to to the yz plane and passing through the X axis along which we can cut the object in order to lead to the fewest support structures.\n",

    "**Introduction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM)* refers to a 3D printing technique in which material such as plastic or metal is unwound from a coil and deposited by a heated nozzle in layers on a surface to produce a 3D printout resembling a 3D model (usually provided in .STL file format). It is an *additive* manufacturing technique, which means that the amount of material used to make an object is very close to the amount of material it actualy consists of. This saves wastages and thus the cost of printing items. This technique is widely used to produce prototypes rapidly which can then be produced by other manufacturing methods. However, the technique does come with some disadvantages. This technique is not quite scalable yet. Depending on the fineness of the printer, the output might not be very sooth. Also, since the material is molten, it might start to bend while being printed and thus need 'support structures' which can cause scars on the model while being removed during post processing. This second problem is what we address in this exercise.\n",

    "Since FDM 3D printers use molten material to produce the output, models which contain like the ones shown in Figure 1 above are likely to droop. This happens because in such models, there is an increased amount of overhang in each subsequent printed layer which causes drooping. This problem is very hard to avoid with current technology and viable materials. One proposed solution is \n",
