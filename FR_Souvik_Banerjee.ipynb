    "# On Minimizing Support Structures Using Surrogate Based Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Surrogate based optimization is used when evaluating a cost function is computationally expensive. We describe a method by which surrogate based optimization using radial basis function networks (RBF networks) can be used to approximate functions, and apply this method to the problem of finding the optimal planar cut of a 3D model such that the number of support structures is minizimed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we extend on the idea in MT2 of finding the optimum cutting plane to minimize the number of support structures by extending the search space to all planes in three dimensional space, instead of only focusing on planes parallel to the YZ-plane as we did in MT2. The main issue with extending this search space is that the time required to compute the number of support structures (the cost function) becomes prohibitively long. Because of this, using techniques like hill climbing or genetic algorithms to find optimal points in this search space is infeasible. The main goal of our project is to approximate the cost function over this large search space using radial basis function networks (RBF networks). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the number of support structures for a 3D model is a computationally expensive operation. We timed how long it took to calculate the number of support structures for printing the Colonel 3D object file provided to us and we found that it took around 15 seconds on a modern machine. If we were to use this directly in a genetic algorithm, for instance, the GA may take many hours or days to run depending on parameters such as the population size and the number of design variables. We attempted to approximate this computationally expensive function using radial basis functions, which are much more efficient to compute **[1]**. Radial basis functions are functions that depend on the distance from a center point(hence the term \"radial\")  **[2]**. Some examples of radial basis functions are the Gaussian function and the multiquadric function. In the following examples, we let $r = || x - c ||$, where $x$ is an arbitrary point and $c$ is the center point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian function:\n",
    "$$\\phi(r) = e^{{- \\epsilon r}^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiquadric function:\n",
    "$$\\phi(r) = \\sqrt{1+ (\\epsilon r)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Radial basis functions have been used before for a variety of applications, ranging from finding solutions of partial differential equations **[5]** and interpolation in surrogate based optimization **[4]**, **[6]**. In **[6]**, radial basis functions are used for \"expensive black-box global optimization\", which is essentially the main goal of this project. In **[6]**, the RBF interpolant is defined as the following. Given $f: V \\to F$, where $V$ is the space of possible inputs and $F$ is a space of scalars, and distinct points $(x_1, f(x_1)), (x_2, f(x_2)), \\ldots, (x_n, f(x_n)) \\in V \\times F$, the interpolant has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ s_n(x) = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_i \\phi(||x_i - c||) + p(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formula, $p(x)$ is a polynomial specific to the choice of $\\phi$. For the two RBFs we are studying, which are  the Gaussian function and multiquadric function, $p(x) = b$ and $p(x) = 0$ respectively (where $b$ is a constant). Finding the values of $\\lambda_i$ \"trains\" the RBF network to approximate values of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, we applied RBF interpolation surrogate based optimization to the problem of finding the optimal cut to minimize the number of support structures. We will first discuss the specific methods we used to collect data and how we evaluated the effectiveness of RBF interpolation. We will discuss how we applied RBF optimization to the one-dimensional case, the two-dimensional case, and its effectiveness at higher dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plane representation\n",
    "We reused some code from MT2 (namely the code to calculate the number of support structures in slicing.cpp). This code expected six design variables to specify the planar cut: the point of the cut and a normal vector to specify the angle of the cut. We found that we could reduce the number of design variables to just 3 by using Hessian normal form **[7]** to specify the plane. In Hessian normal form, one only needs a unit normal vector, and a distance from the origin to specify an arbitrary plane. We let $(a,b,c)$ be the unit normal vector, and we let $d$ be the distance from the plane to the origin. Since $(a,b,c)$ is a unit vector, we know that $c = \\sqrt{1-a^2-b^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison purposes, we first found the global minimum of the cost function. We varied $a$ between -1 and 1 with a step size of 0.2, $b$ from $-\\sqrt{1-a^2}$ and $\\sqrt{1-a^2}$ with a step size of 0.2, and $d$ from $0$ to $100$ with a step size of 10. We found the global minimum to be at the point $(a,b,c) = (0.6, 0.8, 0), d = 70$, with a cost of 16. This is what the cut looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/IoAbBIg.jpg\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "### RBF network implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "We generally used SciPy's RBF network implementation **[8]**, but as an exercise we implemented our own RBF implementation (using some of SciPy's code as a reference). For our RBF network implementation, we used Gaussian radial basis functions, but since SciPy's implementation allows many more types of radial basis functions (including multiquadric functions), we mainly used SciPy's implementation in this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy's RBF network implementation has two additional parameters that are of particular interest to us. These parameters are called $\\epsilon$ and $\\text{smooth}$. $\\epsilon$ varies the \"influence\" of each radial basis function (see definitions in Introduction), and $\\text{smooth}$ varies the \"smoothness\" of the resulting approximated function. Setting $\\text{smooth} = 0$ will force the approximated function to pass through every point in the training set, which may lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One dimensional case\n",
    "For the one dimensional case, we varied the $a$ component (and accordingly $c$) of the normal vector while keeping $b$ and $l$ constant. We set $b$ and $l$ to 0.8 and 70 respectively, because we wanted to vary $a$ near the global minimum point. After obtaining the data, we constructed two RBF networks with SciPy: one network using Gaussian RBFs and one network using multiquadric RBFs. We experimented with the values of $\\epsilon$ and $\\text{smooth}$.\n",
