    "In situations where calls to the cost function are costly, using traditional techniques such as genetic algorithms can be unfeasible. In this report, we expolore the field of surrogate-based optimization using the example minimizing the amount of support structures required to 3D-print a model. We use an Radial Base Function (RBF) in order to model the cost function.\n",
