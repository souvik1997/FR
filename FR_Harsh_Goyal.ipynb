    "# On Minimizing Support Structures Using Surrogate Based Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In situations where calls to the cost function are costly, using traditional techniques such as genetic algorithms can be unfeasible. In this report, we expolore the field of surrogate-based optimization using the example minimizing the amount of support structures required to 3D-print a model. We use an Radial Base Function (RBF) in order to model the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we expand upon our previous project **[1]** by finding an optimum cutting plane for a 3D object in order to minimize the amount of support structures. This time, we are not restricting ourselves to planes parallel to the y-z axis. This drastically increases the search space for the genetic algorithm, thus making it infeasible. This is because calculating the amount of support structures required can take time on the order of 15-20 seconds for a *single individual*. Naively using this cost function for a genetic algorithm can mean that it could take days for a single run (depending on parameters such as population size). Thus, in this project, we aim to remove this bottleneck by approximating the function using a Radial Basis Function, which is much faster to compute. This general technique is called surrogate-based optimization, and has been used in a fields as diverse as, from friction stir welding **[2]** to studying oil reservoir water flooding **[3]**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) are those functions which's value depends only upon the the norm of the input. ie. $$\\phi(x) \\sim \\Phi(|x|)$$\n",
    "This norm is usually defined as the Euclidean distance of the vector from the center and this is what we use, though other definitions are possible. Some examples of radial basis functions are the Gaussian function and the multiquadric function. In the following examples, we let $r = || x - c ||$, where $x$ is an arbitrary point and $c$ is the center point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiquadric function:\n",
    "$$\\phi(r) = \\sqrt{1+ (\\epsilon r)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Radial Basis Functions have been used for \"expensive black-box global optimization\" before. K. Halstrom et al **[4]** used RBF for \"expensive global black box functions\", which mirrors closely the aims of this project. They define the RBF interpolant as the following. Given $f: V \\to F$, where $V$ is the space of possible inputs and $F$ is a space of scalars, and distinct points $(x_1, f(x_1)), (x_2, f(x_2)), \\ldots, (x_n, f(x_n)) \\in V \\times F$, the interpolant has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ s_n(x) = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_i \\phi(||x_i - c||) + p(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formula, $p(x)$ is a polynomial specific to the choice of $\\phi$. For the multiquadratic function, $p(x) = 0$. Finding the values of $\\lambda_i$ \"trains\" the RBF network to approximate values of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall now discuss how we used the RBF interpolation technique in order to minimize the amount of support structures in printing our 3D model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoding the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The code base we were given used six design variables in order to specify which cutting plane to use. We managed to cut the number of design varibles to just 3 by using the Hessian Normal Form **[5]** to represent the plane. The Hessian Normal form is composed of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unit vector\n",
    "\n",
    " This is composed of 3 values; $x$, $y$ and $z$ , which specify the direction of the unit vector perpendicular to the plane. In reality, we only need the x and the y values since we know that $$z = \\left|\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\right|$$\n",
    " \n",
    "* Distance\n",
    " The distance of the plane from the origin in the direction of the unit vector.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Getting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "We use existing code in slicing.cpp to get the data to train our RBF neural network. We vary x and y between -1 and 1 with a step size of 0.2, and l between 0 and 100 with a step size of 10. This gives us ~900 training examples using which we can then train our function\n",
    "\n",
    "For later comparisons, we recorded the parameters which gave us the lowest cost. We found the global minimum to be at the point $(a,b,c) = (0.6, 0.8, 0), d = 70$, with a cost of 16. This is what the cut looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/IoAbBIg.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice was made because in their paper, E. Suwartadi et al **[6]** find that the most important property of a trained RBF model is accuracy in the area of the optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the one dimensional and the two dimensional cases (which we shall touch later in this document), we kept y,z,l and z,l constant respectively while varying the other design variables in order to obtain training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing the RBF Network\n",
    "\n",
    "While we coded our own implementation of an RBF as an exercise (using SciPy's implementation **[7]** as a reference), we mostly used SciPy's implementation as it allows for many more possibilities. For example, it allows us to choose from many different kinds of Radial Based Functions, which is great for experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy's implementation also allows one to specify many parameters, two of which are very interesting to us. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\epsilon$ : Specifies how much influence each training example has on the final function\n",
    "* Smooth : Quantizes the regularization in order to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One-Dimensional Case\n",
    "\n",
    "We made a .txt file containing data for cases where we kept values for y,z and l the same as the optimal case and varied only x from -1 to 1 with a step size of 0.1. Two RBF networks were trained, one using the Gaussian RBF and one using multiquadratic RBF. We experimented with values of $\\epsilon$ and smooth, using graphs to judge whether they were good approximations. We also ran a genetic algorithm to find the optimum value of x using the RBF as the cost function. The genetic algorithm had the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of generations: 20\n",
    "* Crossover probability: 0.8\n",
    "* Mutation probability: 0.3\n",
    "* Crossover method: Alpha blending, with α=0.01\n",
    "* Mutation method: Gaussian mutation, with μ=0, σ=5\n",
    "\n",
    "These were reused from what we found to work well in the our previous project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Two-Dimensional Case\n",
    "\n",
    "This was similar to the one dimensional case, except that we also varied 'y' similarly to how we varied 'x'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results and Discussions\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to judge whether the model is working is two\n",
    " 1. Plot it again training and unseen data.\n",
    " 2. Train using the model as the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall be showing our results using these methods in this section. We vary paramaters such as $\\epsilon$, smooth, the RBF used etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "This model in Figure 1 shows a reasonable approximation to the actual function. We ran our genetic algorithm on this approximated function and we found a minimum cost of 78 at $a=0.426$, which is close to the actual minimum of 16 at $a=0.6$, which affirms that this is a good model.\n",

    "\n",
    "The RBF is being trained on the blue points while the red points are unseen data. It is very clear that overfitting is occuring as the model passed through all the blue points but seems to be avoiding the almost avoiding the red points.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Two-dimensional case\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we present 3D plots of the approximated function using the training data we collected, as we did for the one-dimensional case.

    "\n",
    "This function is a fairly good approximation of both the training and unseen data. However, this seems to break down as $a$ and $b$ increase, as the approximate cost values are negative. One explanation for this is that this case should never happen in practice, since $b$ is limited to the range $(-\\sqrt{1-a^2}, \\sqrt{1-a^2})$. Therefore, as $a$ increases, $b$ should actually decrease. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we used for this experiment signifies a fairly complex situation. The potential of RBFs in modelling complex and computationally expensive cost functions for prediction and optimization purposes is quite clear from how they were able to efficiently fit this data. Our model was bale to produce the minima for the values as expected and as can seen from the graphs, were able to predict the values for unseen data as expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we were not able to finish the three dimensional version of this problem in the given time frame, we are quite confident that we would have been able to accomplish it, simply by looking at the results obtained form the 1D and 2D cases. Perhaps we should have tried to develop some ways to visualize the data in 3 dimensions before proceeding with our approach. It might have also been useful to play around with other paramaters of the RBF. Again, we do not believe that this says anything about the viability of RBF networks for modelling tasks.\n",
