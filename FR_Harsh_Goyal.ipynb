    "# On Minimizing Support Structures Using Surrogate Based Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In situations where calls to the cost function are costly, using traditional techniques such as genetic algorithms can be unfeasible. In this report, we expolore the field of surrogate-based optimization using the example minimizing the amount of support structures required to 3D-print a model. We use an Radial Base Function (RBF) in order to model the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we used a Radial Basis Function (RBF) **[1]** in order to model the amount of support structures required to print a 3D model (in our case, the bust of a colonel). The function can then be used for evaluating the fitness function for, say, a genetic algorithm later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the amount of support structures required to print a 3D model is an expensive operation. In our case, calculating this value for the simple Colonel.obj file can take up to 15 seconds on a modern machine. This problem is compounded when we want to test multiple techniques (for example, multiple kinds of genetic algorithms) as each run of the genetic algorithm can take hours (based on chosen parameters like population size). Thus, a more feasable approach is called for. We tried to solve this problem using surrogate based methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our particul\n",
    "\n",
    "* First paragraph: A short description (3-5 sentences) about your project.\n",
    "* Second paragraph: A *detailed* description of the problem, related work found in the literature. A summary of the structure of your report (what will you be discussing in the upcoming sections?)\n",
    "* Please don't forget to provide any references (**with corresponding numbers**) supporting your sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoding the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The code base we were given used six design variables in order to specify which cutting plane to use. We managed to chop the number of design varibles to just 3 in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The unit vector\n",
    "\n",
    " This is composed of 3 values; $x$, $y$ and $z$ , which specify the direction of the unit vector perpendicular to the plane. In reality, we only need the x and the y values since we know that $$z = \\left|\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\right|$$ . **[a]**\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "* The distance\n",
    " The distance of the plane from the origin in the direction of the unit vector.\n",
    " \n",
    "This can be translated back to the convention used by the codebase using formulas listed in *Appendix A*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "We use existing code in slicing.cpp to get the data to train our RBF neural network. We vary x and y between -1 with a step size of 0.2, and z between 0 and 100 with a step size of 10. This gives us ~250 training examples using which we can then train our function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 1 dimensional case\n",
    "\n",
    "For the problem that we are presenting, it makes sense to break it down into parts. Hence, we begin by considering the one dimensional case, in which we only vary the x value while keeping the y and l constant. After training, we got the following graph when we set $\\epsilon = 0.1$ and $smooth = 1$ To see what these parameters represent, please see *Appendix B*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this graph, the green dots represent data that the network was trained on and green dots represent unseen data. Now, when we change the smooth function to 0, we get the following graph, which is clearly overfitting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, it would be quite easy to use this model to get the cost function for each individual in a genetic algorithm quickly, whereas the same would have taken 10-15 seconds *(per individual!)* using slicing.cpp\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 2 dimensional case\n",
    "\n",
    "We did an exercise similar to the 1D case but now in two dimensions, keeping the l values constant but varying the x and the y value. This is the graph that we obtained in this case. The light green nodes represnt the data that we used to train the function while the dark green nodes represent the unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are expected to use an evolutionary algorithm; please provide the details of your implementation (which operators you use?, how do you calculate the fitness values?, etc.)\n",
    "* Please provide the statistics about your calculations.\n",
    "* If you use a simulation, physics engine, analytical test problem or parametric design for 3D printing, give the detailed description of that.\n",
    "* You can provide example figures about the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results and Discussions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can provide a figure showing the fitness values versus generations. \n",
    "* Results obtained with different algorithm settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Wrap up your work like you do in Abstract section and provide detailed summary of the results. \n",
    "* If your approach didn't work, you can still give the arguments to help potential readers to avoid the same mistakes.\n",
